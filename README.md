## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub page of my project! What you can find in this repository, is the project I had to complete for the 3rd semester "Database Systems" course at the University of Vienna. This project was made up of a couple of different parts.\
At the beginning of the semester we had to make a concept of a database using an Entity-Relationship model, then reform this diagram to a relational model, and at the end implement this as SQL code. After I had my database ready in SQL, I had to create a Java application, that filled up the relations of the database with semi-random data. Furthermore I also had to create a website using HTML5, CSS and PHP, which is able to access said database and is able to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete operations. [You can reach the website here.](http://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~peteri00/index.php)\
This website and the database is hosted on the servers of the university (Almighty), and therefore the SQL dialect I had to use was specified by their database, which is Oracle SQL. In the following paragraphs I will describe each section of the project in detail.
